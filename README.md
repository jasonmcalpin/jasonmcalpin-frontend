### Code Quality Tools

This project uses several tools to ensure code quality and consistency:


#### Lint-staged

Lint-staged runs linters on staged files to catch issues before they're committed:

- TypeScript/React files: ESLint and Prettier
- CSS/SCSS files: Prettier
- JSON/Markdown files: Prettier

#### Commitlint

Commitlint ensures commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Deployment

The site uses a sophisticated deployment strategy:

### Staging Deployments

When you create a pull request to the `main` branch:

- The PR build is automatically deployed to the staging site (staged.jasonmcalpin.com)
- The PR will be updated with a comment containing the staging URL
- A PR_INFO.txt file is added to the deployment to track which PR is currently on staging

After a PR is merged to the main branch:

- The main branch is automatically deployed to the staging site
- A BRANCH_INFO.txt file is added to the deployment to indicate it's the main branch

This allows you to review changes before merging to main. The staging site uses the root path to ensure `.htaccess` rules work correctly.

### Production Deployments

The site is deployed to production only when a version tag is pushed:

1. Ensure your changes are merged to the `main` branch
2. Create and push a version tag following semantic versioning:

   ```bash
   # Make sure you're on the main branch
   git checkout main
   git pull

   # Create a new version tag
   git tag v1.0.0  # Use semantic versioning (v{major}.{minor}.{patch})

   # Push the tag to trigger deployment
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy to production

#### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

- `v1.0.0` - Major release with significant changes
- `v1.1.0` - Minor release with new features
- `v1.0.1` - Patch release with bug fixes
