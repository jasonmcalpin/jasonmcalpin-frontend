# Security Checklist for jasonmcalpin-react

This document provides a comprehensive checklist of security measures implemented in this project and recommendations for ongoing security maintenance.

## Implemented Security Measures

### HTTP Security Headers
- [x] X-Frame-Options (prevents clickjacking)
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options (prevents MIME type sniffing)
- [x] X-XSS-Protection (basic XSS protection)
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security (enforces HTTPS)
- [x] Content-Security-Policy (restricts resource loading)
- [x] Referrer-Policy (controls referrer information)
- [x] Permissions-Policy (restricts browser features)

### HTTPS Enforcement
- [x] Force HTTPS redirect in .htaccess
- [x] HSTS header implementation

### CORS Protection
- [x] Restricted CORS configuration (domain-specific)
- [x] Proper CORS headers for allowed methods and origins

### File and Directory Protection
- [x] Prevent directory listing
- [x] Protect sensitive files (.htaccess, .git, etc.)
- [x] Robots.txt configuration to prevent crawling of sensitive directories

### Dependency Security
- [x] Dependabot configuration for automated vulnerability scanning
- [x] NPM security check scripts
- [x] Package resolutions for known vulnerable dependencies

### Documentation
- [x] Security policy (SECURITY.md)
- [x] Cloudflare WAF configuration guide
- [x] Security checklist (this document)

## Regular Security Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Run `npm run security-check` to identify vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review Dependabot alerts and pull requests
- [ ] Check for new security patches for dependencies

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies with `npm update` or by merging Dependabot PRs
- [ ] Review and update Content Security Policy if needed
- [ ] Check for any new security best practices to implement

### Quarterly
- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive security review
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- [ ] Update security headers based on current best practices
- [ ] Review and update WAF rules if using Cloudflare

## Security Testing Tools

Consider using these tools to regularly test your application's security:

1. **OWASP ZAP** - Free security testing tool for finding vulnerabilities
2. **Mozilla Observatory** - https://observatory.mozilla.org/
3. **Security Headers** - https://securityheaders.com/
4. **CSP Evaluator** - https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/
5. **Snyk** - For dependency vulnerability scanning

## Security Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions
2. **Validate all data** - Even if not from user input, validate and sanitize all data
3. **Implement proper error handling** - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Use secure coding practices** - Follow OWASP guidelines
5. **Minimize attack surface** - Only expose necessary functionality
6. **Regular security testing** - Conduct periodic security assessments
7. **Stay informed** - Keep up with security news and best practices

## Additional Security Considerations

### If Adding User Authentication
- [ ] Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2)
- [ ] Use secure session management
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Set secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection

### If Adding Forms or User Input
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Use CSRF tokens for all forms
- [ ] Validate data on both client and server side
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for submissions

### If Adding API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Validate all input parameters
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

This checklist should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves and new security best practices emerge.
